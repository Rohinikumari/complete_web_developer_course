        media franchise managed by The Pokémon Company, a company founded by
        Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. The franchise was created by
        Satoshi Tajiri in 1996,[4] and is centered on fictional creatures called

        the franchise are set in the Pokémon universe. The English slogan for
        the franchise is "Gotta Catch ‘Em All!".[5][6] There are currently 913
